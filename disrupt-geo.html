	<h2>Disrupt Geo</h2>
	<br>
	<div style="text-align:left;margin-left:50px;margin-right:50px">
	Disrupt Geo is a meeting of academics, industry professionals, non-academic researchers, and activists to show their geo projects, tools, hacks, and critiques. Our goal is to create a lively interaction between different perspectives, with a low barrier to entry: no elaborate prepared presentations required!
	<p><p>
	The format is a mixture of 5 minute lightning talks, Q&A sessions, and discussion. Topics include the geoweb, citizen science, DIY drone aerial photography, humanitarian mapping, and whatever else you may think of!
	<p>
	<h3>Session 1: 1:20-3:00</h3>
	<h4>Lightning talks/unconference Session #1 (40 minutes) 1:20-2:00pm</h4>
	<p>
	A lightning talk is a very short presentation lasting only 5 minutes. It needs no advanced preparation (or slides or tools), although you may use a few if you like. Mostly you need to stick to the time limit!

	<p>
	Panel will remain on stage, but audience is free to ask questions of any of the previous speakers. Panelists can continue to respond to each other in their answers, and continue the discussion.
