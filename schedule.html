									    	<div>This session focuses on as US State department initiative that addresses the critical planning needs of secondary cities around the world.  Secondary cities are the fastest growing areas in developing countries, experiencing unplanned growth and development.  These cities are unique environments that have generally been poorly mapped with limited data and information on infrastructure, land tenure, and planning.  Mapping Secondary Cities for Resiliency and Emergency Preparedness builds local capacity in using open source geospatial technologies, strengthens international partnerships, and creates new data in secondary cities that are frequently data-poor, under-resourced, and lagging behind in the provision of infrastructure and essential services. Mapping these cities is an essential activity in building resiliency and devising robust emergency management plans. Panelists are demographers and urban specialists who will discuss the major issues facing secondary cities and the way forward to address these challenges.<p>Moderator:  Debbie Fugate</p></div>

Citizen volunteers work together towards creating and extending open geodatabases in OpenStreetMap for humanitarian response and sustainable development efforts. These volunteer contributions bring numerous benefits and open spatial data to developing countries and vulnerable cities. Through public mapping initiatives such as the State Department's MapGive initiative, smaller and larger institutions can provide mapping support by sponsoring resources and increasing education, awareness, and outreach to address mapping gaps. There are numerous opportunities to foster a platform for local, regional, national and international  stewardships in this field. The session will present several case studies from various organizations that demonstrate the success of these mapping initiatives as well as present examples of successful partnerships and future paths towards collaboration.<p>Organizer:  Tom Gertin</p><p>Presenters: Tom Gertin, MapGive State Department; Sven Fuhrmann, GMU; Chad Blevins, USAID GeoCenter, Drishtie Patel, American Red Cross/Missing Maps; Vivien Deparday, World Bank GFDRR</p></div></td>

The program was founded in 2014 by Texas Tech University, George Washington University, and West Virginia University. With support from the USAID's GeoCenter, we will offer leadership and fellowship opportunities for students around the world, facilitate exchange on joint collaboration, conduct activities to support female mappers and provide a network for building opportunities in this growing revolution.  In this panel, we will share how students and faculty can participate in this platform to enhance research and teaching related to open geospatial data and analysis that address well-identified needs in the developing world.<p>Participants: Patricia A.
