	Please join the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in illuminating how open mapping can help achieve the sustainable development goals. We are calling on citizen mappers around the world to host or participate in mapathons in conjunction with the 2016 White House Mapathon. 

	<p><p>

	On July 7, 2016, citizen mappers will make at least 25,000 open mapping edits at the White House Mapathon. Itâ€™s up to you how many edits are made worldwide.
